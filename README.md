Develop a top down, helicopter firefighting game using IntelliJ as an IED, and the Codename One framework. Through each revision, new principle and concept would be explored;
</p>

<p>
A1. </br>
* Design the base came. Provide a simple location (River) from which the helicopter can gather water and randomly generate 3-5 fire for the player to put out. </br>
* Impliment keyboard base movement.
</p>


<p>
A2. </br>
* Impliment building and modify the fires to only spawn in the building. </br>
* Impliment a basic UI scoreboard to keep track of the fire size, number of fires, building health, and building damage. 
* Impliment UI to display Helicopters onboard water amount as well as Helicopter speed. 
* Assign a random value to each building and value and reduce value as fire damages building</br>
* Add the ability to turn the helicopter engines on and off</br>
</p>

<p>
A3. </br>
* Redisign Helicopter to have sleds, tail, tail rotor, main rotor, and cockpit</br>
* Make the rotors movable and rotatabe to indicate the state of the Helicopters engines</br>
* Make the helicopter to move as a whole</br>
</p>

<p>
A4. </br>
* Redesign and impliment score board.</br>
* Create an AI controlled second player to flow a second helicopter which can be told which fire to fight using a mouse click.</br>
* Highlight which fires are being fought by the AI Helicopter.</br>
